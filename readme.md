EmulationStation Theme - pg-breath 0.1
======================================

Intro
-----

A clean and minimalistic theme for EmulationStation to be used in large screens.
I would say that 42" is the minimum. It's not 100% finished but you can try it.
Take into consideration that system names are a bit different from other themes
around.

  - gba-crt - Game Boy Advance (cartridges)
  - gbc - Game Boy Color
  - gbo - Game Boy
  - lnx - Atari Lynx
  - mdr-crt - Megadrive/Genesis (cartridges)
  - nes-crt - NES (cartridges)
  - ps1 - Playstation (1)
  - sgg - Sega Game Gear
  - sms - Sega Master System
  - snt-crt - Super Nintendo (cartridges)
